# Project report


## Introduction

### What are you building?

An app to post (user-uploaded) pictures, requiring authentication.

### Why are you building it?

The project for FAC Week 4: [a server-side app](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/apprenticeship/server-side-app/project/)

## Project scope


### What are you not building? (stretch goals that were discarded?)

- Delete button
- Automatic deployment
- A full test suite

### How did you decide what features were important?

- prioritised authentication since this was something we were keen to get a better grasp of
- uploading files introduced new challenges, so this took up quite a lot of focus, building on earlier work with database requests

## Project plan

### What order are you going to build in?

- Set up repo
- Project file structure
- "Boilerplate" code
- Hello world test
- Authentication
- "Content" features

### How will you delegate work?
- Assign roles
- encourage people to work collaboratively when needed
- allow people to pick roles they feel confortable with 


## Project learnings:
- improved workflow/less conflicts 

### Did your team work effectively?
- Our team certainly worked well together. We communicated clearly and kept each other updated on what issues we were facing. We pair (and group) programmed to address issues which helped progress the project a lot quicker.


### What would you do differently next time?

- Make sure errors are being properly logged as soon as possible, and definitely before spending too much time hunting down a "mystery" bug!


## Requirement analysis:

### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

- WCAG guidelines
- Lighthouse (posts page passing with 100!)
- ARIA attributes
- Alt text as required input, loaded dynamically with images


## Recommendations and conclusions:

### What features would you prioritise to build next?
- The ability to delete your own post(s) and filter through images would improve the user journey.
- refine some of the user journeys (e.g. signup not leading to login page)

### Was the project a success?
- Yes, the project requirements were all met and, most importantly, we learned a lot while working on the application. 
- Users can upload an image that displays onto the web page- this relates to our chosen spike project.
